## 🔧 Data Analytics Customer Segmentation

### 🔍 Project Overview

This project focuses on conducting a **Customer Segmentation Analysis** for an automobile bike company using the **RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary)** model. By analyzing customer purchase behavior, the project categorizes customers into meaningful segments to drive targeted marketing strategies and boost sales. The analysis results were visualized through an **interactive Tableau Sales Dashboard**, while **data cleaning** and **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** were performed using Python.

### 🎯 Objective

To leverage customer segmentation through RFM analysis, identifying actionable customer groups to help the automobile company:

- **Enhance sales revenue** by targeting specific customer segments.
- **Improve customer retention** and loyalty.
- Gain insights into **customer behaviors** for informed decision-making.

### 🔬 Key Insights and Features

1. **Age Distribution of Customers:**
   - Majority of both new and old customers are aged between **40-49 years**.
   - Very few customers fall under the **under 20** and **above 80** age groups.
   - A noticeable drop in new customers aged **30-39**.

2. **Gender Trends:**
   - **Females** accounted for **51% of bike purchases** in the last 3 years, slightly surpassing males.
   - Numerical difference: **10,000 more female purchases** compared to males.

3. **Industry Insights:**
   - Most new customers belong to **Manufacturing** and **Financial Services** industries (~20%).
   - Least representation comes from **Agriculture** and **Telecom** (~3%).

4. **Wealth Segmentation:**
   - Across all age categories, most customers fall into the **Mass Customer** segment.
   - The **40-49 age group** has more affluent customers outperforming High Net Worth individuals.

5. **RFM Segmentation:**
   - Customers are divided into **11 segments**, including **Platinum Customers**, **Very Loyal Customers**, and **Potential Customers**.
   - Recent and frequent customers contribute significantly to **revenue**.

6. **Car Ownership Insights:**
   - States like **New South Wales** have the highest proportion of **non-car owners**, while **Queensland** shows the opposite trend.
